# REFLECTIONS

Most challenging:
Understanding branching and merging helped me see why a clean commit history and frequent pushes to the remote repo are important.
Most interesting:
Using code formatters and linters like Black and Flake8 to automatically improve code quality.
What I learned:
I gained confidence in Git workflows, especially in creating branches and handling pull requests.
